# Process Documentation – Number System Converter

## Group Members & Roles
- Member 1 – Project Manager (coordinates tasks, communicates with lecturer)
- Member 2 – UI/UX Designer (designs app screens, user flow)
- Member 3 – Frontend Developer (builds React Native interface)
- Member 4 – Algorithm/Logic Developer (writes conversion functions & tests)
- Member 5 – QA & Documentation (testing, prepares docs, ensures quality)

## Meetings Log
- **Week 1, Day 1:** Project kickoff, assigned roles, created GitHub repo, added lecturer as collaborator.  
- **Week 1, Day 2:** Discussed number system algorithms, researched binary/decimal/hex conversions.  
- **Week 1, Day 3:** Algorithm developer created `conversion.js`, QA tested logic with sample numbers.  
- **Week 1, Day 4:** Frontend developer started UI skeleton in React Native.  
- **Week 1, Day 5:** UI/UX shared mockups, team agreed on layout.  
- **Week 2:** Integration and documentation writing in progress.  

(Keep updating this log each time your group meets or makes progress!)

## Tools Used
- **GitHub** – version control and collaboration  
- **Node.js & Jest** – testing the conversion logic  
- **React Native (Expo)** – mobile app framework for Android/iOS  
- **VS Code** – code editor  

## Timeline
- **Week 1:** Repo setup, roles, algorithm design & implementation.  
- **Week 2:** Build UI, connect logic, start documentation.  
- **Week 3:** Testing, polishing, prepare for deployment.  
- **Week 4:** Submit final report, demo app, and share APK/Store link.  

## Challenges & Solutions
- Understanding base conversion steps → solved by hand examples + code tests.  
- Learning React Native basics → plan to use Expo (simpler cross-platform).  
- Deployment to stores (Apple/Google) → team will prepare APK and screenshots, even if not fully published.  

## Next Steps
- Integrate `conversion.js` into mobile app UI.  
- Expand documentation with screenshots of the app.  
- Record demo video for submission.
